## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
As Github cannot preview interactive charts, to view them in full you will need to download the file and open in Google Colab. Due to data confidentiality, the data cannot be hosted for free on Github, so you will be unable to run locally. A full description of the data is contained within the notebook.

The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/tomjhagan/portfolio/blob/main/customer-review-analysis/Applying_NLP_for_customer_review_analysis.ipynb).
