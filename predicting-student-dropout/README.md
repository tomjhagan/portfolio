## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
Due to data confidentiality, the data csv cannot be hosted for free on Github, so you will be unable to run locally. A full description of the data is contained within the notebook.

The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/tomjhagan/portfolio/blob/main/predicting-student-dropout/notebooks/eda_and_model.ipynb).
