    "Applying NLP for topic modelling is crucial for data analysis in business because it enables companies to identify and understand key themes and patterns within large volumes of text data. This efficiency allows businesses to extract essential insights and trends without manually sifting through extensive documents. Automated topic modelling helps businesses make informed decisions faster, which helps to improve productivity and gain a competitive edge. Additionally, it supports better information management by uncovering underlying topics in reports, emails, customer feedback, and market research, which enhances overall business intelligence and strategic planning."

    "The PureGym Group, founded in 2008, has approximately 2 million members and 600 gyms across the world (particularly in the UK, Denmark, and Switzerland). As one of the world’s largest value fitness operators, PureGym appeals to a broad range of customers by offering high-quality, low-cost, and flexible fitness facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This focus on the customer is centred on wanting to understand what motivates members to join and what factors influence their behaviours once they have joined. Internet reviews provide a large data set of natural language containing positive, negative and neutral customer experiences that would require an enormous amount of time to analyse manually. Using machine learning to derive insights and trends from the data can generate actionable intelligence much more time effectively, which can be used to improve the customer experience while retaining the value-for-money proposition."
