# Detecting Anomalous Activity of a Ship's Engine
This project uses both statistical and machine learning methods to identify anomalous activity of the engines of various ships. Anomalous activity could be an indicator of malfunction within the engine, as such identifying these ships before engine failure allows for timely maintenance, reduced downtime and increased safety,

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

The notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/tomjhagan/portfolio/blob/main/anomalous-ship-telemetry/notebooks/eda_and_model.ipynb).
